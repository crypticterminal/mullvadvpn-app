# Mullvad VPN app architecture

This document describes the code architecture and how everything fits together.

For security and anonymity properties, please see [security](security.md).

## Mullvad vs talpid

Explain the differences between these layers and why the distinction exists.
My thought was that after this section every aspect of the app is explained
under either the Mullvad or the Talpid header. So it's clear which part they
belong to. I yet don't know if this makes sense though.


## Mullvad part of daemon

### Frontend <-> system service communication

### Talking to api.mullvad.net

### Selecting relay and bridge servers

### Problem reports


## Talpid part of daemon

### Tunnel state machine

The tunnel state machine is the part of Talpid that coordinates the events for establishing a VPN
connection. It acts upon requests for establishing a secure VPN connection or for disconnecting an
already established connection and returning the system to its initial state. This involves also
using other parts of Talpid to configure the system so that the security policies are applied and
so that the connection works correctly without any further manual configuration necessary.

The tunnel state machine starts in an initial `Disconnected` state. In this state, no changes are
made to the operating system and no security policies are applied. When a request is sent to the
state machine to establish a connection, the state machine will progress first into a `Connecting`
state that will configure the operating system and setup a tunnel with a connection to a VPN server.
Once the configuration is complete and the connection is verified to be working, the state machine
then proceeds to a `Connected` state.

A request can be made to close the VPN connection. Such request will lead the state machine into
a `Disconnecting` state, which will close the connection to the VPN server and restore the operating
system to its original configuration. After the process is complete, the state machine returns to
the `Disconnected` state.

If an error occurs in the `Connecting` or `Connected` states, the state machine may proceed to an
`Error` state. It might reach this state either immediately (when an error occurs in the
`Connecting` state) or after passing through another state to tear down the tunnel (when an error
occurs in the `Connected` state). Either way, in this state the operating system is configured to
block all connections to avoid leaking any data. The objective is to ensure no data leaks from the
tunnel while the user has requested a secure connection, as defined in the [security document].

A high-level overview of the tunnel state machine can be seen in the diagram below:
